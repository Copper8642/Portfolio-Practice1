    What does your program do?
        - It will allow users to search games by genres (or by single letters of fractions of words), upon searching for a genre they will be given a small list of games
            each with a price and review rating.  The user will then be asked if they want to search again, or not (which will end the program)

    What data do you need?
        - I need a list of games and genres

    What questions will you ask the user?
        - "What genre would you like?" (as well as the follow ups if the input isn't clear)
        - "Would you like to search again?"

    How do the above questions return a recommendation?
        - If the users inputs cannot be whittled down to a single genre, it will suggest possible genres and ask again.
            If the users inputs can be whittled down to a single genre, the games within that genre will be shown.
